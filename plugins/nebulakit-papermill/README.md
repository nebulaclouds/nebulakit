# Nebulakit Papermill Plugin

It is possible to run a Jupyter notebook as a Nebula task using Papermill. Papermill executes the notebook as a whole, so before using this plugin, it is essential to construct your notebook as recommended by Papermill.

To install the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install nebulakitplugins-papermill
```
