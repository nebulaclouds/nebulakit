# Nebulakit BigQuery Plugin

BigQuery enables us to build data-intensive applications without operational burden. Nebula backend can be connected with the BigQuery service. Once enabled, it can allow you to query a BigQuery table.

To install the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install nebulakitplugins-bigquery
```

To configure BigQuery in the Nebula deployment's backend, follow the [configuration guide](https://docs.nebula.org/en/latest/deployment/plugin_setup/gcp/bigquery.html#deployment-plugin-setup-gcp-bigquery).
